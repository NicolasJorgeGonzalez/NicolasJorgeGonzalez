My name is Nicol√°s Jorge, an enthusiast dedicated to web development who is currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at FAMAF (UNC). I've been creating software since I was sixteen years old, focusing on creating efficient, visually engaging digital experiences that significantly improve user interaction.

I have experience developing access control systems and web applications for Socio Plus, where I continue to contribute. Additionally, I am currently working on my own project: a web platform designed to streamline and manage manufacturing processes.

I thrive in team environments and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve outstanding results. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges, continually seeking to expand my skills.
